In this conversation, i want you to help me live coding, brainstorming about problem statement understanding step by step, brainstorm about variants of the problem itself and the implementation as well

With the problem in leetcode, the structure of leetcode itself is just the class solution and the function receiving the datastructure like string, vector,... and return... But in this practicing lab repo, you need to setup the whole C++ file including parsing the correct input to a suitable datastructure (list or vector or string...) and output the result to the file, we have the standard structure:

problems/<problemname>/input.txt
problems/<problemname>/output.txt
problems/<problemname>/solution.cpp

Makefile will contain the logic for running
